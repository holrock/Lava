1. Introduction
=============================

Lava is a load sharing and distributed batch queueing software that 
integrates a network of computers running UNIX systems.  It consists 
of the following components:

Lava Base:
    The software upon which all the other components are based. It 
    includes two servers, the Load Information Manager (LIM) and 
    the Remote Execution Server  (RES). 

Lava Batch:
    The set of utilities providing batch job scheduling for distributed 
    environments, ensuring optimal resource sharing. It includes the
    master and slave batch daemons (mbatchd and sbatchd).

2. Directory Structure
=============================

The contents of directories are:

README: This file.

Makefile:
        Make(1) control file for compiling the source.

config.h
        Internal include file for handling platform dependent
        prototype definitions.

lsf/
        Source code for building the Lava base daemons and tools, including 
        the lim, pim, res, nios, and all ls* commands.

lsbatch/
        Source code for building the Lava batch scheduling daemons and tools,
        including the mbatchd, sbatchd, and all b* commands.

eauth/
        Source code for building the external authentication daemon

chkpnt/
        Source code for building generic echkpnt and erestart framework

=============================
4. Notes
=============================

1. Lava eauth only provides the external authentication framework. Customer 
   needs to use their own encryption and decryption logic and pass external 
   authentication data using this framework.

2. Platform Lava is not compatible with Platform LSF. Customer who needs 
   to upgrade from Lava to LSF must drain all the jobs before upgrading. After 
   Platform LSF installation, user needs to copy over all the configuration 
   files (and setting). Accounting file and Event file can not be upgraded to 
   Platform LSF.
